# KNMI Weather MCP

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@wolkwork/knmi-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@wolkwork/knmi-mcp)

A FastMCP server that provides real-time weather data from KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) weather stations. This application fetches the latest 10-minute measurements from the nearest weather station to any location in the Netherlands.

## Features

- Get weather data for any location in the Netherlands
- Automatically finds the nearest KNMI weather station
- Provides real-time measurements including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Precipitation
  - Visibility
  - Air pressure
- Natural language interpretation of weather conditions
- Location search functionality
- Detailed logging

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- KNMI API Key (get one from [KNMI Data Platform](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/))
- `uv` package manager

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install KNMI Weather for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wolkwork/knmi-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wolkwork/knmi-mcp --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd knmi-mcp
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   KNMI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Server

### Using Claude AI

To use this application with Claude AI, run the following command in the folder of the project:

```bash
uv run fastmcp install src/knmi_weather_mcp/server.py
```

This will add the following configuration to your Claude configuration file (typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
    "KNMI Weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "fastmcp",
        "--with",
        "httpx",
        "--with",
        "netCDF4",
        "--with",
        "numpy",
        "--with",
        "pandas",
        "--with",
        "pydantic",
        "--with",
        "python-dotenv",
        "--with",
        "xarray",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "/Users/<username>/<git location>/knmi-mcp/src/knmi_weather_mcp/server.py"
      ]
    }
}
```

Note: If you see an error like this:

```
spawn uv ENOENT
```

Replace the `uv` command with the full path to the `uv` command. On *nix systems this can be found with the command `which uv`.


### Manual Running

For development or standalone usage:

```bash
uv run fastmcp run src/knmi_weather_mcp/server.py
```

## Available Tools

### 1. what_is_the_weather_like_in

Get a natural language interpretation of current weather conditions for any location in the Netherlands.

Example:

```python
await what_is_the_weather_like_in("Amsterdam")
```

### 2. get_location_weather

Get raw weather data for a location.

Example:

```python
await get_location_weather("Rotterdam")
```

### 3. search_location

Search for locations in the Netherlands.

Example:

```python
await search_location("Utrecht")
```

### 4. get_nearest_station

Find the nearest KNMI weather station to given coordinates.

Example:

```python
await get_nearest_station(52.3676, 4.9041)
```

## Logging

The application logs are stored in the `logs/knmi_weather.log` file, providing detailed information about:

- API requests and responses
- Weather data processing
- Error messages
- Debug information

## Data Sources

This application uses the KNMI Data Platform API to fetch data from the "Actuele10mindataKNMIstations" dataset, which provides 10-minute interval measurements from all KNMI weather stations in the Netherlands.

## Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:

- Invalid locations
- API authentication issues
- Network problems
- Data parsing errors
- Missing measurements
